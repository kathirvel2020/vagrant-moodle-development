## Description

This repository provides a Vagrant based system to create a Moodle LAMP instance running a Ubuntu Trusty64 virtual machine using the VirtualBox. This is perfect for local testing and development installations.

After setup is complete you will have a Moodle LAMP instance running in a virtual machine on your local development computer.

The resulting package will include:

* LAMP (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
* Moodle (latest version)
* Moodle add-ons/plugins including:
  * Local: Code Checker
  * Filter: multilang2
  * Atto: multilang2
  * Theme: Adaptable
  * Theme: Bootstrap
  * Language Pack: French
  * Language Pack: French Canadian
* Moodle MDK
* Moodle Moosh
* Boris
* Mercurial SVN
* Git
* phpMyAdmin
* Self-signed SSL certificate
* Unzip
* XDEBUG

This has been tested using Vagrant 1.8.1.

Status: ALPHA

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure that you have installed the following applications on your local development computer:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Changes

2016-03-15 - Initial version. See the CHANGELOG.md for additional information.

## Installation and Configuration

Clone this project

    git clone git@github.com:michael-milette/vagrant-moodle-development.git mymoodle
    cd mymoodle

Add the following line to the *hosts* file on your local development machine:
...on Windows - c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
...on Ubuntu  - /etc/hosts
...on OS X    - /private/etc/hosts

    dev.local 192.168.33.33

If you want to use a different IP address, you will need to modify it in *Vagrantfile*.

You may also want to customize the fillowing files:

* *config\moodle-repo.git* - This file contains the URL to the Moodle Git repository (you can point it to your own fork).
* *config\moodle-branch.git* - This file contains the version of Moodle that you want to install. Example: MOODLE_30_STABLE.

## Security considerations

The vagrant environment created is only suitable for local development and testing and should not be used for a publicly accessible websites without additional security hardening.

## Usage
    
The following commands can be executed from within the mymoodle directory:

* vagrant up - starts the virtual machine. If running for the first time, will install everything required for Moodle development.
* vagrant ssh - connects you to the virtual machine in a terminal.
* vagrant suspend - hybernates the virtual machine in its current state.
* vagrant halt - shutdown the virtual machine gracefully.
* vagrant destroy - Deletes the virtual machine.
* vagrant help - Displays a complete list of vagrant commands.

## Future

Some ideas we are toying with for the future include adding the ability to do the following during installation:

* Optionally also create WordPress and Drupal environments.
* Use a MariaDB or PostgresSQL database instead of MySQL.
* Use Nginx instead of Apache.
* Cache the installation files for Moodle, WordPress and Drupal to reduce download time.
* Performance optimization.
